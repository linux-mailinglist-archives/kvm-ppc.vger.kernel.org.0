While it's N*M files, only O(M) statsfs API calls are needed to create
them.  Whether you have O(N*M) total kmalloc-ed objects or O(M) is an
implementation detail.

Having O(N*M) API calls would be a non-started, I agree - especially
once you start thinking of more efficient publishing mechanisms that
unlike files are also O(M).

Yes, this is also why I think percpu values should have some kind of
native handling.  Reporting per-CPU values individually is the exception.

Yes (or a separate CPU source in my model).
