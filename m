Oh nice, thanks for testing. How's this?

KVM: Fix page ref underflow for regions with valid but non-refcounted pages

It's possible to create a region which maps valid but non-refcounted
pages (e.g., tail pages of non-compound higher order allocations). These
host pages can then be returned by gfn_to_page, gfn_to_pfn, etc., family
of APIs, which take a reference to the page, which takes it from 0 to 1.
When the reference is dropped, this will free the page incorrectly.

Fix this by only taking a reference on the page if it was non-zero,
which indicates it is participating in normal refcounting (and can be
released with put_page).
