Well, sure, I'm just trying to get an order of magnitude here.

I'm not sure that necessarily follows.

Hmm.  I feel like this could still easily be 10s, maybe 100s of
milliseconds, yes?  Given that typical migration downtime caps are
also in the 100s of milliseconds, this still seems troublesome.  Since
this is part of the device migration itself, this flushing will all
happen during the downtime, but won't be factored into the downtime
estimations.

Why would a guessable value be bad?  The counter would be per-guest,
so AFAICT all a malicious guest could do is mess itself up.

I don't think you need to: if there are pending flushes on migration
you can set the dest counter to the max id of those, if not you can
reset it to 1 without harm.

Actually.. come to think of it, can't you just use the current max id
of pending flushes + 1 as a new id.

Right, but it's good to be defensive here.  I think a bad guest could
initiate this path even if it's not supposed to yes?
