For memory-backend-ram the fd is set to -1. The fdatasync would fail 
later. This restriction is for preventing the hcall failure later. May 
be it is intentionally allowed with nvdimms for testing purposes. Let me 
know if you want me to allow it with a dummy success return for the hcall.

Mix configurations can be attempted on a nested setup itself.

On a side note, the attempts to use pmem=on on non-pmem backend is being 
deprecated as that is unsafe pretension effective commit cdcf766d0b0.

I see your point, adding "pmem-override"(?, suggest me if you have 
better name) to spapr-nvdimm can be helpful. Adding it to spapr-nvdimm 
device. With pmem-override "on" device tree property is added allowing 
hcall-flush even when pmem=on for the backend. This works for migration 
compatibility in such a setup.

Yes. I have changed the patches to move all the flush specific data 
structures into the spapr-nvdimm object.

It would actually be wrong use for kernel to attempt that. The device 
tree property is checked before setting the callback to flush in the 
kernel. If someone makes the hcall without the device tree property 
being set, it would actually be a mistaken/wrong usage.

For pmem-override=on, its better to allow this as you suggested along 
with exposing the device tree property. Will call the pmem_persist() for 
pmem backed devices. Switch between pmem_persist() or fdatasync() based 
on the backend type while flushing.
